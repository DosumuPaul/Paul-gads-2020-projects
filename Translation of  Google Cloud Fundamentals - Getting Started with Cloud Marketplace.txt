LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Cloud Marketplace

OBJECTIVE:
In this lab, you learn how to launch a solution using Cloud Marketplace.

STEPS:

1.  Use Cloud Marketplace to deploy a LAMP stack.

  - In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Marketplace.

  - In the search bar type LAMP CERTIFIED BY BITNAMI.

  - On the LAMP page, click Launch.

  - Select a preferred zone

  - Accept the GCP Marketplace terms and conditions if prompted to do so.

  - Click Deploy

     *NOTE: The status of the deployment goes from  lampstack-1 is being deployed to
    lampstack-1 has been deployed once the software has been installed succesfully.

2.  Verify your deployment.

   - When the deployment is complete, you can click the Site address link in the right pane. This displays
   a congratulations message in the tab.

   - On the GCP Console click SSH, this opens a new window

   - In the new SSH window, change the working directory using this commamnd:

       cd /opt/bitnami

   -  Copy the phpinfo.php script from the installation directory to a publicly accessible location under 
     the web server document root, execute the following command:

       sudo sh -c 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > apache2/htdocs/phpinfo.php'

       * Now The phpinfo.php script displays your PHP configuration. This is used often to verify a new PHP 
      installation.

   - Close the SSH window using this command:

       exit

   - Open a new browser tab and type the following URL, replacing SITE_ADDRESS with the URL in the Site 
    address field in the right pane of the lampstack page in this manner
